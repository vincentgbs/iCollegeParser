This script is meant to be run WITHIN the folder that is downloaded and unzipped from iCollege.

This script is meant to parse a bulk downloaded file into folders that hold each student's submission, instead of one folder with all submissions. It should also rename the file to the relevant class name. Special characters within the student's name or the java class name can break the script. There will be some files that will still need to be parsed by hand.
